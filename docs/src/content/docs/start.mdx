## Install

```sh
npm install --save-dev mistcss
```

Assuming your components are in `./components`:

```json title="package.json" copy
{
  "scripts": {
    "mistcss:dev": "mistcss ./components --watch",
    "mistcss:build": "mistcss ./components"
  }
}
```

You may want to use [concurrently](https://github.com/open-cli-tools/concurrently) to run `mistcss:dev` in parallel with your dev server.

When building, `mistcss:build` must be run first.

## Write

Let's say you want to write a button component. It should have a default style and accept variants:

```css title="./components/Button.mist.css"
@scope (button.custom-button) {
  :scope {
    background: black;
    color: white;

    &[data-variant='primary'] {
      background: blue;
    }

    &[data-variant='secondary'] {
      background: gray;
    }
  }
}
```

:::note

The above code is 100% valid CSS and natively supported by browsers.

:::note

MistCSS components support enum, boolean and string props. See [Writing Components](component).

:::

## Build

```shell
npm run mistcss:dev
# MistCSS will create ./components/Button.mist.tsx
```

## Use

Use it in your app. No JS/TS were written âœ¨

```jsx title="App.tsx"
import { CustomButton } from './Button.mist'

export const App = () => <CustomButton variant="primary">Save</CustomButton>
```

:::note

MistCSS supports creating React, Astro and Hono components. See [frameworks](./integration/frameworks).
